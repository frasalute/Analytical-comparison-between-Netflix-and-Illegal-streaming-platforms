# Analytical-comparison-between-Netflix-and-Illegal-streaming-platforms
INTRODUCTION

Whether someone is interested in tv series or movies, action or drama, documentaries or sci-fi, it is nowadays common practice to use streaming platforms as a form of access to this kind of entertainment. A streaming platform is an on-demand online entertainment source for TV shows, movies, and other streaming media, i.e. multimedia that is delivered and consumed in a continuous manner from a source, with little or no intermediate storage in network elements. This is just a fancy way of saying that streaming platforms deliver directly from the platform to the consumer.

The question is: Why are we interested in them and what exactly are we looking for by studying them?

We are interested in them because everyone knows them and uses them due to the growing popularity of legal and accessible streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Disney+, which makes them an obviously fascinating topic to elaborate on. Additionally, legal platforms are different from illegal ones and that creates a very nice ground for a detailed comparison between the two categories. This perfectly explains why we will deepen on the matter and study the behavior people have towards them.
In this analysis, we will focus on what people find convenient about one type of platform or the other, we will proceed to try to understand if there are connections between these characteristics and the choice of the platforms made by individuals, and finally, we will draw our conclusions on why some platforms are preferable compared to others and what is considered dislikable about them.

1.1 SURVEY DESCRIPTION
We created and designed the survey using Google Forms tool. We have been able to collect 111 responses from our families, friends and University colleagues from all over the world. One of our goals in this part was to receive as many responses from different socio- demographic backgrounds as possible. We decided to conduct the survey in English. Eventually, we analyzed our collected data with one of the most widely used statistical analysis and data visualization software packages SAS.
The survey included 4 different types of questions:
Sociodemographic questions, used to understand personal aspects and social backgrounds of the sample.
Quantitative questions, in order to comprehend the opinions of the respondents and how they value specific attributes of our topic on a scale from 1 to 7; 1 representing "I hate it" and 7 representing "I love it".
Behavioural questions, which are based on the habits of our participants of the survey related to the topic.
Lifestyle questions, in order to perceive the attitudes and daily routines of our respondents.
