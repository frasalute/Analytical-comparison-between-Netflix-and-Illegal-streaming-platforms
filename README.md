# Analytical-comparison-between-Netflix-and-Illegal-streaming-platforms
# INTRODUCTION

Whether someone is interested in tv series or movies, action or drama, documentaries or sci-fi, it is nowadays common practice to use streaming platforms as a form of access to this kind of entertainment. A streaming platform is an on-demand online entertainment source for TV shows, movies, and other streaming media, i.e. multimedia that is delivered and consumed in a continuous manner from a source, with little or no intermediate storage in network elements. This is just a fancy way of saying that streaming platforms deliver directly from the platform to the consumer.

The question is: Why are we interested in them and what exactly are we looking for by studying them?

We are interested in them because everyone knows them and uses them due to the growing popularity of legal and accessible streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Disney+, which makes them an obviously fascinating topic to elaborate on. Additionally, legal platforms are different from illegal ones and that creates a very nice ground for a detailed comparison between the two categories. This perfectly explains why we will deepen on the matter and study the behavior people have towards them.
In this analysis, we will focus on what people find convenient about one type of platform or the other, we will proceed to try to understand if there are connections between these characteristics and the choice of the platforms made by individuals, and finally, we will draw our conclusions on why some platforms are preferable compared to others and what is considered dislikable about them.

# 1.1 SURVEY DESCRIPTION
We created and designed the survey using Google Forms tool. We have been able to collect 111 responses from our families, friends and University colleagues from all over the world. One of our goals in this part was to receive as many responses from different socio- demographic backgrounds as possible. We decided to conduct the survey in English. Eventually, we analyzed our collected data with one of the most widely used statistical analysis and data visualization software packages SAS.
The survey included 4 different types of questions:
Sociodemographic questions, used to understand personal aspects and social backgrounds of the sample.
Quantitative questions, in order to comprehend the opinions of the respondents and how they value specific attributes of our topic on a scale from 1 to 7; 1 representing "I hate it" and 7 representing "I love it".
Behavioural questions, which are based on the habits of our participants of the survey related to the topic.
Lifestyle questions, in order to perceive the attitudes and daily routines of our respondents.

# 1.2 PREPARING DATA FOR SAS ANALYSIS
We created an Excel table with all our data and we changed the name of the variables to make the commands in SAS easier. To identify the sociodemographic variables we chose the letter 'd', 'q' for qualitative questions, for the behavioral variables the letter 'b', and 'l' for lifestyle ones. Then we saved the file as a text file and imported it into SAS to start the analysis.

# SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS

# 2.1 FREQ PROCEDURE
First of all, we have completed the frequency procedure with sociodemographic variables in order to understand our sample data and the distribution of variables. The command we used allowed us to calculate the number, percentages, and cumulative percentages of our respondents falling in a specific category of our categorical variables.
From SAS results represented as tables, we can see that majority (66,67%) of our replies came from people that are aged between 18 to 25 years old, while percentages of replies from the other age segments (<18; 26-35; 36-50; 50+) are 4,5%, 18,92%, 5,41%, 4,5% respectively. In addition, most (59,46%) of our respondents identify themselves as females, 33,33% as males, 4,5% as non-binary, 1,8% as gender-fluid, and the rest of respondents preferred not to say their gender.
Considering our main topic we were expecting a higher percentage of replies from students, we have included the third question (d_3) about the status in our survey in order to verify and know the exact percentage of students in our sample. They made up for 43,24% in total, followed by workers (36,04%), and people who are both: students and workers (16,22%). Also, we collected replies from 3,6% of unemployed respondents and 0,9% retired.

Having information about the number of family members of our respondents we were also keen to know whether there are families that have siblings or kids younger than 18 years. We were considering the hypothesis that having younger members of the family could affect the choice between Netflix and illegal streaming platforms. Results showed that the majority of the respondents (72,07%) do not have siblings or children that are underaged in their families. 

# IMPORTANCE QUESTIONS AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS
# 3.1 MEANS PROCEDURE
We began our analysis of the Importance data with the means procedure, which allows us to see main statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. It calculates the average value for each variable, in this way we can understand which variables are most important in our sample.
In addition, standard deviation measures the dispersion of the values around the mean: the further the values are, the greater the standard deviation.
From the table above we can see that Netflix's convenience of having no advertisement and high resolution (q_2) and the access to other countries' productions (q_14) of illegal platforms are the most important variables to describe the choice between Netflix and illegal platforms in our sample. Because their means are respectively 5.5 and 5.53 out of 7. Our respondents are not that concerned about catching malware or viruses (q_17) while using illegal streaming platforms.
Variables q_10 (longer waiting time due to copyright) and q_11 (parental control) have the lowest standard deviation, which means that respondents' responses did not vary much around the mean.
The biggest SD (2.09) comes from the variable of watching simultaneously with friends without multiple accounts (q_19), which represents the fact that most people disagree about their judgment of this illegal platforms' feature. From the results, we can also see that people also disagree a lot about less waiting time for illegal streaming platforms (2.05).

# 3.2 PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS
Principal component analysis is a factor transformation of our original dataspace with which we aim to reduce the number of dimensions of a dataspace while preserving the essential part of variability. The outcomes of this analysis are: a correlation matrix, an eigenvalue table, and an eigenvector table.
From the input dataset consisting of "n" rows and "p" variables, "p principal components" can be computed, each one of which is a linear combination of the original variables, with coefficients equal to the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix.
We can start with the correlation, which is a measure that spans from -1 to +1 and describes the linear relationship between two variables.
Two variables move in the same direction (when one increases, the other goes up as well) if the correlation coefficient is positive, and in opposite direction (when one increases and the other decreases) the coefficient is negative. If the correlation is +1 or -1 we can see the perfect linear dependency, while if it is equal to 0 the two variables are not correlated. Correlation then is the ratio of the covariance (measurement of confusion on a data space) of the two variables to the product of their standard deviations.
We can see the highest positive correlation coefficient (0.84) between wider content choices (q_12) and access to other countries' productions (q_14) of illegal streaming platforms. The highest negative correlation (-0.42) is between access to many languages in both audio and subtitles on Netflix( q_7) and pop-up and explicit pop-ups in illegal streaming platforms (q_16). It makes sense because people who are willing to access other countries' productions automatically could have a wider content choice in illegal streaming.
However, most correlation coefficients are positive, which means that our matrix is inflated by a positive correlation trend. And, since our variables have some linear dependency between each other we are not operating in Euclidean space (in which all variables are independent and orthogonal). As a consequence, we cannot use either the Ward method or the other algorithms based on distance measurements of our units to create clusters.
Our database should have a 0 correlation to be useful for our clusterization because each variable needs to have a specific meaning in characterizing the clusters.

Each eigenvalue is the length of each principal component and thus it describes the variability associated with each PC. We have 21 PC since we have 21 variables. We can find the portion of the variability that each PC represents by dividing its length by the sum of all their lengths, which is equal to 21.
To understand which PCs are most important to the general global variability we have to compare each eigenvalue to the benchmark (the expected value which is equal to 1). According to this benchmark strategy we have to select only those principal components with eigenvalues similar to or bigger than 1.
In this case, we can select the Principal Components 1-2-3-4 and also 5, since 0,99 is very close to 1, representing 69% of the variability (as we can see in the cumulative column) passing from 21 dimensions space to a space with 5 dimensions.
We can describe the other principal components as noise generated by the mind of the respondents that confounds the similarity structure of our data.
In the eigenvector table, we see the correlation between each original variable and principal component.

Looking at the correlation between our variables and PC1 we see that we have almost no trade-off, in fact when one variable increases almost all the others do the same. We have size effect, as also the positive trend in the correlation matrix suggested to us.

# 3.3 SIZE EFFECT
Size effect is a very common phenomenon in these types of surveys about opinions. It is the general trend of our measurement and it creates distortion and inflation in the data set.
This phenomenon is a consequence of the subjectivity of the people about the perception they have of the scale when they are rating, which depends on the average level in the mind of people participating and is related to emotional and cultural variables.
We need to eliminate this distortion (and the size effect) by transforming our original variables based on a scale from 1 to 7 into new variables, with a new scale from -1 to +1, in which -1 is the minimum, 0 is the average and +1 is the maximum.
